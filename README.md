Pint-oh-four-eight
==================
An extremely rapidly developed (~30 minutes) alcohol-based derivative of 2048.

The blocks form ever more appealing beverages ending at the correct form of a pint. This was developed while 2048 was recently released, and no 2048  generators had yet come into existence. 

Driving motive was to get people to stop working, and head to the pub. It worked.
